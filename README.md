#twittler
Twittler is a twitter clone that uses jQuery to fetch randomly generated posts from a JavaScript file. It represents a user's home page, where they can view recent posts of their friends.

This is a solo project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta).
